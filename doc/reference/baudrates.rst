Baud rates to use on the actuator's baudrates
---------------------------------------------

TODO: Where it is defined and where to use the baud rate

The standard values are:

- B0
- B50
- B75
- B110
- B134
- B150
- B200
- B300
- B600
- B1200
- B1800
- B2400
- B4800
- B9600
- B19200
- B38400
- B57600
- B76800
- B115200

B1000000 corresponds to :math:`10^6` bauds. It is not a standard POSIX value but is accepted on linux and Mac OS X. This is also the default baud rate for a newly bought actuator.
